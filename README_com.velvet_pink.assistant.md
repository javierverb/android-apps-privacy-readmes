    Google Account Information: Upon authorization, we access and store your email address and profile data to link your Google account with the AI Assistant.
    Calendar Data: The AI Assistant interacts with your Google Calendar to create, update, or delete events based on your requests. This includes event titles, dates, times, descriptions, and related metadata.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information gathered for the following purposes:

    Calendar Management: To create, modify, or delete events in your Google Calendar as per your instructions.

4. Data Security

We prioritize your data's security and take multiple steps to ensure its protection:

    Hosting: The Service is hosted on AWS EC2, a secure cloud environment with strong protection mechanisms against unauthorized access.
